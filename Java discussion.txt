Abstraction  
 will specify only essential features with out informing inner 
 details.

Inheritance

	obtaining properties from parent classes

Polymorphism
	same form (signature) but different implementations


interfaces -> 
all methods are abstract and public
implements (insteadof extends)
variables are static and final

package
	group related functionality classes together into a 
	single unit

	     SameClass Samepackage  differntpkgsubclass difpkg
private        Y            N            N                 N

default        Y            Y            N                 N

protected      Y            Y            Y                 N

public         Y            Y            Y                 Y

		Collections
dynamic size and can hold multiple data types at the sam etime

import java.util
	
		Collection(I)
		
	List (I)	Set (I)		Map (I) (map is not implementing collection)

ArrayList (C)		HashSet()	HashMap
LinkedList		LinkedHashSet   LinkedHashMap
			TreeSet		TreeMap


Map is a Key and Value Pair...


		Exception Handling


try
	is a block where you will keep the business logic which 
	might causethe exception
catch
	is a blcok, which can handle the exception
finally
	is a block, can be executed always 

throw
	is used to manually throw the exceptions in your application
throws

		Files

java.io.
OutputStream (I)			InputStream (I)
byte oriented classes
FIleOutputSTream(C)			FileInputStream
DataOutputStream(C)			DataInputStream
ObjectOutputStream(C)			ObjectInputStream

write the information into files...       read the information from file

Character 
Writer					Reader
FileWriter			FileReader





Thread (C) implements Runnable		      Runnable (I)

start() -> method			      run() method 
	is responsible to start the thread.
	that means, it will call the run method in background.


Through out your JVM, you will have only 1 instance. 
	.. Loading properties files
	.. loading some database information


Factory Design pattern
		Will provide one of the class from the family hierarchy
